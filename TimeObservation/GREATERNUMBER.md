# Learnings

13/03/2024
This was my first approach trying to learn about efficiency practices while coding in Python.
I learnt the below points:
- Built in functions are more effective than user defined codes (if-else) that does the same purpose.
- max() does not work semantically, the arguments need to be different, i.e, if the arguments are equal, the function returns the first argument as the greater number 
even if the inputs are equal.
- While trying to arrange the time variables in ascending order, I came across Dictionaries as a more convenient way to portray which coding segment is the most 
efficient, but it needs to be looked into later on (use Key-Value pairs).
- If you give, x=print("blah blah blah"), this holds None as its value
